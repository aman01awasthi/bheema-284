       <h1>Our Project (Team â€” Aluminium)</h1>
       <p><a id="c" href="profile.html">Bheemudu Guguloth</a></p>
       <p>Firstly as a team, we would like to express how grateful we are to Masai School for giving
            us this wonderful opportunity to learn under their guidance and for sharing our
             first project experience which we had done remotely.</p>

             <p>5. Abhishek Vasant Satpute</p>

             <h3>Introduction</h3>
             <p>Our task was to implement our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge which we had learned at Masai. We used this skillset to build a static copy of bathandbodyworks.com along with the responsiveness.</p>
             <h3>How we started the project</h3>
             <p>Actually we don't know how to build website , when we learn something from masai we started this project with just a few simple questions like what we can do in this project and in this short span of time how much we can deliver, what major points we should consider, and how to implement communication while working remotely. We were able to identify all the problem one shall face while building the project and had necessary guidelines in place which would help us move forward step by step rather than jumping and opening many things at a time.</p>
             <h3>The platform used for communication</h3>
             <p>For delivering a result-oriented output of any work/project communication between the team is the most crucial part. We used slack and zoom to communicate with each other. The effective and goal-oriented approach towards communication made this task a lot easier for us.</p>
             <h3>Challenges</h3>
             <p>1.Git-pull and push of the code.</p>
             <p>2.Merging each other code for the first time.</p>
             <p>3.Adding javascript for functionalities.</p>
             <h3>Takeaways</h3>

             <p>To be able to work on a project the team members must possess leadership qualities, he/she should be able to contribute ideas and be respectful to others.</p>
             <p>Overall, it was a surreal experience, and we look forward to many such challenges.</p>
